### **Who are we?**
We are a community-driven initiative dedicated to building **lightweight, open-source smart assistants**. Our mission is 100% transparency; we believe the future of AI should be open, auditable, and easy for anyone to recreate from scratch.

### **What do we do?**
We don't build locked-down products—we build **starter projects**. Our goal is to eliminate the "hard first bit" of development, giving you a functional foundation to build your own custom AI. Whether you use our assistants as a plug-and-play solution or as a framework for your own invention, the power is in your hands.

*   **See it in action:** Explore our [hub1 Live Demo on Wokwi](https://wokwi.com).

### **How can you join us?**
Open source is powered by people like you. Here is how you can help grow the ecosystem:
*   **Contribute:** Submit a Pull Request to optimize our code or add new features.
*   **Test:** Build a project and [report bugs or issues](https://docs.github.com) to help us improve.
*   **Document:** Help others get started by refining our guides and tutorials.
*   **Share:** Star the repository and share our demos with your fellow builders.

### **Thank you!**
Thank you for taking the time to check out our work. Building in the open is only possible because of curious developers and makers like you. We can’t wait to see how you adapt these assistants to make them your own!
